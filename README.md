# Pickachu Chrome Extension

Pickachu is a lightweight toolbox for quickly picking information from any webpage. It provides seven simple pickers for grabbing colors, elements, links, fonts, images, text and generating selectors.

Open the popup and choose a tool. After making a selection on the page, the extracted data is copied to your clipboard and shown in a small modal.
